# shtest-run-at-line is intended to exercise the %dbg(ARG) mechanism
# thoroughly on bash, windows cmd.exe, and lit's internal shell.  While
# %data/%for expand the ARG within %dbg, they don't emit any new shell
# constructs, so we shouldn't need to try every shell again.  To make it easy
# to write these tests portably, we thus try just lit's internal shell here.
