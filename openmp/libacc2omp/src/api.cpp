/*****************************************************************************
 * Data and memory management routines.
 *
 * Handling of null pointers:
 * - The behavior is often not clearly specified in OpenACC 3.1.
 * - We attempt to follow a concept discussed by the OpenACC technical
 *   committee: a null pointer is considered always present.  Specifically, we
 *   assume the behavior is as if there is an "acc data" enclosing the entire
 *   program that maps a host null pointer to a device null pointer so that the
 *   structured reference count is always non-zero.  Because a null pointer
 *   doesn't actually point to data, we also assume that the number of bytes
 *   specified to a routine is ignored and that any update requested for a null
 *   pointer does nothing.
 * - We document each routine's specific handling of null pointers in more
 *   detail below and relate it to this concept where applicable.
 *
 * Handling of bytes=0:
 * - The behavior is usually not clearly specified in OpenACC 3.1.
 * - We attempt to mimc nvc 20.9-0 as much as possible:
 *   - Except for acc_is_present, for all routines that accept a bytes argument,
 *     do nothing other than returning a null pointer where the return type is
 *     void*.
 *   - For acc_is_present, handle bytes=0 like bytes=1.  This behavior follows
 *     OpenACC 3.1.
 *   - These behaviors seem to, at least partially, address the second potential
 *     use case below.
 * - Potential use cases:
 *   - bytes=0 for data of size > 0:
 *     - This is part of a more general use case of specifying bytes<N to
 *       operate on data of size N>0 when it is not convenient to determine the
 *       exact value of N at the routine's call site.  That is, this use case
 *       relies on N already stored in the present table.
 *     - The current behavior of enter/exit-data-like routines does not support
 *       this use case for bytes=0 though it does for bytes>0: it does not
 *       adjust dynamic reference counts and perform any consequent deletions or
 *       data transfers.  It does nothing.
 *     - This use case does not include other data and memory management
 *       routines, which operate on exactly the specified bytes not on N bytes.
 *   - bytes=0 for data of size 0:
 *     - That is, imagine an application that maps N>=0 bytes to the device and
 *       then calls various data and memory management routines for a subset,
 *       M<=N.  Imagine we want the application to gracefully handle (not fail
 *       for) the cases of M=0 and N=0.
 *     - To support the M=0 but N>0 case, it usually sufficient for acc_malloc,
 *       enter/exit-data-like routines, update routines, acc_map_data, and
 *       memcpy routines to do nothing when bytes=0: the specified address is
 *       present but operations on the subset M become no-ops.  acc_deviceptr,
 *       acc_hostptr, and acc_is_present indicate presence for the base address
 *       of the M bytes as when M>0.
 *     - The same is true for the M=N=0 case except that acc_deviceptr,
 *       acc_hostptr, and acc_is_present now indicate absence for the base
 *       address.  Whether that's desirable may be application-dependent.  It
 *       might be argued that application code that would invoke those for the M
 *       bytes would often be naturally skipped when M=0 (for example, in a loop
 *       with M iterations).
 * - Alternative behaviors:
 *   - Modify bytes=0 behavior for consistency with bytes>0 behavior to better
 *     support the above use cases and so that these routines agree with
 *     acc_deviceptr, acc_hostptr, and acc_is_present about when a (data_arg, 0)
 *     pair is considered present:
 *     - Modify acc_malloc: return a unique device address that can be passed to
 *       acc_map_data with bytes=0.
 *     - Modify enter-data-like routines and acc_map_data when address is not
 *       already present: create a present table entry for the address with size
 *       0.  As for bytes>0, enter-data-like routines should map a unique device
 *       address, and acc_map_data behavior should be undefined if the specified
 *       device address is not unique.  Unique device addresses are for the sake
 *       of acc_deviceptr and acc_hostptr.
 *     - Modify enter/exit-data-like and acc_map_data routines when address is
 *       already present: behave like the bytes>0 case.  That is,
 *       enter/exit-data-like routines should adjust the dynamic reference count
 *       and perform any consequent deletions or data transfers.  acc_map_data
 *       should produce a runtime error.
 *     - Modify update routines: check for presence even though bytes=0.  This
 *       seems fine if present table entries can have size 0.  Even so, the
 *       check could be viewed as redundant given that no bytes will actually
 *       by transferred.
 *     - One use case this alternative does not address: an accidental attempt
 *       to map two consecutive memory ranges with the same starting address
 *       because the size of the first range has fallen to zero.  This case
 *       would have to be handled specially in the application to avoid runtime
 *       errors or undefined behavior.  Such undefined behavior could occur when
 *       the ranges are consecutive only on the device side when, for example,
 *       acc_malloc is being used for memory pooling.
 *     - acc_is_present, for example, would no longer have identical behavior
 *       for bytes=0 and bytes=1.  This at least represents a subtle change from
 *       previous behavior.
 *   - Produce runtime errors:
 *     - The current bytes=0 behavior may be confusing due to inconsistencies
 *       with the bytes>0 behavior.
 *     - The previous alternative behavior to avoid that confusion has subtle
 *       differences in reference counting from nvc's current behavior and
 *       could thus lead to memory errors that are difficult to debug in
 *       existing applications.  Moreover, runtime errors or undefined behavior
 *       may still occur for the bytes=0 case but not the bytes>0 when
 *       attempting to map consecutive memory ranges.
 *     - Always producing a runtime error for bytes=0 would avoid all these
 *       problems.  It might be the best option if the above use cases are
 *       not worthwhile to support.
 * - These alternative behaviors need to be discussed with the OpenACC
 *   technical committee.
