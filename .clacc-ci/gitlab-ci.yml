# Instead of using artifacts, just build in an NFS-mounted directory,
# $BUILD_DIR, that's unique to each pipeline in case there are concurrent
# pipelines.  Why not use artifacts?
#
# - LLVM's build directory is huge.  For me, it's 46G when including just
#   the clang and openmp subprojects, which are required for Clacc, and it's
#   85G when including nearly all subprojects.
# - At this size, it takes a long time to upload/download between stages and
#   can be rejected as an upload because of its size.  For me, it added 20
#   min to the already 30 min build of that 46G and then was rejected.
# - Artifacts are posted for download and stored long past when it's useful
#   for humans to download the LLVM build directory, which is typically
#   never.
# - We could squash the pipeline to one stage to avoid the need for
#   artifacts, but pipeline stages are a convenient way to view results when
#   debugging.
#
# The NFS solution used here is based on the following comment (which is in
# response to a proposal for a gitlab feature that would solve this
# problem):
#
#   https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/29265#note_225288132
#
# However, because the NFS-mounted build directory name is different for each
# pipeline, ccache misses if we compile within it.  Thus, we set
# CCACHE_NOHASHDIR and CCACHE_BASEDIR (neither alone proves sufficient), as
# suggested by the ccache manual.  CCACHE_NOHASHDIR can lead to incorrect
# directory names in debugging symbols, but currently we don't expect those to
# matter to our CI builds.

# to discover Clacc test fails sooner after a push, and it makes it easy to
# see whether all Clacc tests have succeeded without the need to hunt the
# results of a check-all that has failed due to some upstream problem that
# does not concern Clacc.  check-all then repeats those Clacc tests
# unfortunately, but that's ok as the Clacc tests are relatively fast.
#
# The additional build required for the test suite can be very noisy and
# exceed the log output limit.  Run that first, grep for key text, and
# make the full version an artifact.
#
# When there are fails, the test suite run can be very noisy too and
# exceed the log output limit.  It's hard to grep for just the important
# stuff, so just print it all but also dump to an artifact.
